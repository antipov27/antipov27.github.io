## Why I chose to study Management Information Systems?

MIS combines all areas of my interest, needs and innovative technology.

My family runs a number of diverse businesses, to the development of which I am willing to contribute through the introduction of innovative project management and data analysis practices.

This goal has allways been clear to me, however the path to achieving it remained unknown. One of my ATAs in the ICS 101 lab, shined light on the MIS major and from there I firmly decided to pursue it.

In today's business success equation, programming skills are crucial. Entrepreneurs need to understand and apply programming for organizational success.

Additionally, efficiently analyzing data directly impacts accurate managerial decisions. Entrepreneurs must grasp and apply these skills.

In conclusion, these factors led me to choose MIS as my third major.
