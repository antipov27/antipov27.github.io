### Assignment 1

Assignment 1 has been a challenge and a great learning opportunity.

My programming skills have improved by me learning how to create a working application from instructions with limited ways. I have learned how to use and adapt CSS templates and dynamically output content. I improved my ability to work with loops, in particular for data validation.

To improve my programming skills, I need to work more on functions and build a deeper understanding of how to use them.

The WODs have taught me how to approach a programming task by first mapping out what I will do in my head and only then writing the code. Also, I know can do the WODs without watching the screencast.

The labs are the most challenging part of the class. I had spent a lot of time working on them at home after class. At times I would fall behind in class, because of a step not working and then I would have to spend hours figuring out how to do it at home. This has been by far the least enjoyable part of class, but it helped me form an understanding of each module.

Assignment 1 was enjoyable, I learned how to slowly, step by step solve a big task. I am well familiar with the code of my application, and I am ready to work on Assignment 2.

I think the class can be improved by removing the grading of labs. I feel like too much pressure is put on students to receive one point for a massive task and that instead of learning how to do the lab, we focus on doing it in a way that will definitely bring the full point.

WODs have been the most helpful part of class. Creating a solution yourself is what allows to master the skill.
