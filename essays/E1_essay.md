### Workout of the day 1
The first WOD consisted of creating a simple web page using HTML. This was the hardest WOD for me to do. Not so much due to the content, but due to it being my first experience of creating a screencast with a voice-over and the uploading it to YouTube. I found the OBS vide recorder to be the most effective and can can strongly recomend it.

My first attempt took me about an hour to complete. The reason to this was, that I took the approach of completing each step using HTMLDog's tutorial to learn what it is that I am doing. This has been extremly helpfull and I strongly recomend taking some time on your first attempt to play around and learn. My second attempt went smooth and I got it within RX, 14 minutes. The remaining 3 attempts were taken due to issues with recording and on my 5th attempt I got the WOD done in 11 minutes.

### Workout of the day 2
The second WOD had me apply CSS definitions to the previously created html file. They where associated with changing the font family, font color and background color.

It took me 2 attempts to complete it. On my first attempt I took my time to interact with the HTMLDod's CSS tutorial and learn from it, completing the WOD in 30 minutes. Everything went smooth, aside from the fact that at first I though that the font had to be changed using Google Web Fonts (the directions have confused me). On my second attempt, I didn't run into any issues and was able to complete the WOD in 7 minutes, Rx time.
