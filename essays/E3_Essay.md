### WOD Invoice 1

The last WOD I have completed was Invoice 1. The goal of the WOD was to create a simple invoice for 5 products using variables to define price, quantity and tax (percentage value), and expressions to compute extended price, subtotal, tax (dollar value) and total. More about the WOD can be found on the following page: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html

Performing most of the WOD was easy and smooth flowing for me. I completed it in 32 minutes (Sd). Combing HTML and JS using <script> tags was straight forward at this part of the class, as well as defining variables and executing expressions. The part which slowed me down, was representing price figure within text. We had to include a $ in front, and as the price value was entered as a variable through ${} I got a bit confused. Also the use of the .toFixed() method slowed me down, when figures had to be defined to two decimal places.

To prepare I reviewed the W3 schoolâ€™s tutorial to review how to create and modify an HTML table. This helped me be on top of things when time came to record the WOD. One thing that we did different is in the smartphone variables lab we outputted variables through document.write(), wheras in this lab I used the ${} placeholder for the same purpose.

To be better prepared (in terms of doing the WOD faster) I could have practiced more before recording, since this recording went a bit longer than usual. Other than that, I feel that I was well prepared. In future WODs I might try this approach of practicing more prior to recording.
