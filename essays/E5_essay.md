### Assignment 2

Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
What did you learn from this assignment?

The goal of Assignment 2 was to modify our existing application, in my case a hotel website, by adding a login and registration page as well as carrying user data in the query string to output it on a dynamically generated invoice. 
I learned how to do all the above, but more importantly I learned how to solve tasks with vague guidelines and limited prior knowledge about them. I was able to implement server side user data validation and password encryption which have been two absolutely new topics to me, but with the use of online resources, chat gpt and professor Port’s assistance I was able to do it.


Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).

I worked by myself, so I should say that I did 100% of it. However, professor Port assisted me on correcting and modifying approximately half of my work.


How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?

I needed help with new and unfamiliar areas, these where user data validation, password encryption, output of error messages and carrying the data in the query string. My main source of help was Daniel Port. I would message him on discord with questions, set appointments and stay behind after classes. The help I received was detailed and useful.


How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?

This assignment was very different to assignment 1. Assignment 1 was a smooth transition from all the previously covered material (and worked with in the WODs), so it was mainly doable. With assignment 2 it was very difficult to create a whole assignment without prior experience with topics used. So the main difference was having to look up and integrate unfamiliar topics.


Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

I spent 10% of the time thinking on how to do the task. 50% of time was taken to write, modify and integrate the code. 40% of time was spent on testing and debugging, most of which was debugging.


Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?

I started early and took things step by step, which helped me avoid many potential issues. The bit which didn’t work well was trying to generate all of the code for error message output through chat gpt. That didn’t work, because chat gpt isn’t good on creating large chunks of code for an existing application, so I had to do it myself based on early guidelines from professor Port.

If I could go back I would have done things the way I did, because I was able to finish early.
